# HW 1

The purpose of this simple homework is (a) to become familiar with submitting your homework, which consists of the following steps

- create a colab notebook, 
- make it editable,
- obtaining a shareable link and enter it in Webcourses, and
- save the notebook to your GitHub repo,

and (b) to become familiar with Python and numpy.

## Problem 1

Create a GitHub repo with a simple readme file. Enter the link to your repo in Webcourses.

## Problem 2

Inside a colab notebook implement a Python function ```multiply_matrices``` that takes as input a list of numpy arrays and outputs their product.  It should raise a custom exception if there is a pair of incompatible matrices.  The exception message should provide information about which pair of matrices is bad. Make sure that you follow the style guide for Python. Also use simple markup for formatting your notebook and include a simple description of what your program does inside a text cell.  You should also use some simple Latex commands, for instance, when explaining what it means for two matrices to be compatible.

Make this notebook editable (so the TAs can directly put comments in the notebook), obtain a sharable link, enter it in Webcourses, and also save this notebook to your GitHub repo inside the folder called ```HW_1```.
