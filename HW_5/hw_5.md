### Homework 5

**Problem 1**

Summarize and describe the different concepts/methods/algorithms that you have learned in this course.

Use a Colab notebook. Make sure that you organize the material logically by using sections/subsections. Also, use code cell to include code snippets.

I suggest that you group everything into five categories:

1. General concepts (for instance, what is artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning)

2. Basic concepts (for instance, here you can talk about linear regression, logistic regression, gradients, gradient descent)

3. Building a model (for instance, here you can talk about the structure of a convent, what it components are etc.)

4. Comping a model (for instance, you can talk here about optimizers, learning rate etc.)

5. Training a model (for instance, you can talk about overfitting/underfitting)

6. Finetuning  a pretrained model (describe how you proceed)

Take this homework *very seriously*.  You have the opportunity to make up for lost point on previous homework assignments.
